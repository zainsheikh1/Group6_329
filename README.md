Our CPSC 329 Jeopardy Game starts by running the main in JeopardyFrontend.java. There are several features of our program to consider:
- Background music
- Cyphertext hacker mini-game
- 5 Categories of questions based on CPSC329 concepts: 1). I heard you're good at math, 2). Cybercriminal Methods, 3). Linux & Mocha, 4). BlockChain, 5). History and Rules. Each category has a group of questions separated with scores 100,200,300,400 and 500. There are several questions behind each score square. Every time the user starts the game, the questions are randomized, and he/she will encounter different questions through each round. 
- There are 97 questions in the game.
- Back button
- Scoring System: the game keeps the score when the user correctly answers the questions.
- Once the game is over, the user will see a pop-up window that displays the score achieved by the end of the game. 
- User may replay a game or exit.

The final D2L submission includes:
- A README file with a GitHub URL
- Walkthrough video
- A slideshow of CPSC320 FALL2020 memories.
